          <p>My background is in traditional drawing, painting, and ceramics, though I have always had a comfort and love for technology. I grew up building websites and began my studies in traditional software engineering and web development while earning my Bachelor of Fine Arts at UT Austin through their Elements of Computing program.</p>
          <p> In the years since, I have made a body of paintings, built projects for the web, and helped small businesses and other creative people with software-related tasks through development projects and support.</p>
